# @morevm/creative-theme-switcher

This is an implementation of a theme switcher component inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qHHm7ooavo). \
I made it for fun with love for detail, accessibility and usability, as part of a series of videos dedicated to this element.

[Check out how it looks](https://morevm.github.io/creative-theme-switcher)

If you are interested in how to draw and animate such an element in Figma,
watch the [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gkJsxJgFaI) or

Have a nice day :)
